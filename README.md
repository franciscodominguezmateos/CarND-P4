## Advanced Lane Finding
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

The goals / steps of this project are the following:  

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
DONE
* Apply the distortion correction to the raw image.  
DONE
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
DONE
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view"). 
DONE
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find lane boundary.
DONE
* Determine curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
DONE
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
DONE
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
DONE

All information, code, comments and images are in P4-17020801.ipynb.
